what is Random Ascii Face Bot?

Put simply, its a bot that responds with a random ascii face (╯°□°）╯ built in

# Development

  npm install
```

# Todo's
* Name all ascii faces so that you can ask for a specific ascii face

  e.g. /raf flipTable should respond with:

  (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻

* Add a method to output all faces with names (so you can determine which)
  ascii face you may like to use

  e.g. /raf all should respond with:

  flipTable: (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
